# Erosion Detect

This repository contains a simple notebook demonstrating how to train an erosion detection model.

The notebook `notebooks/erosion_detection.ipynb` downloads an example dataset, generates synthetic sensor data, computes correlations between the images and sensors, and trains a small neural network that combines image and sensor features.

To run the notebook:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/erosion_detection.ipynb
```
